NetworkActivationTimeoutEx_INVALID=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value is not a valid Timeout, such value is not a valid Network Activation Timeout. \
Network Activation Timeout is the amount of time to wait the Network Activation feature to operate. \
0 represents an infinite timeout.

NetworkActivationProtocolEx_EMPTY=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value is an empty String, such value is not a valid Network Activation Protocol.
NetworkActivationProtocolEx_INVALID=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value is not one of {1}, such value is not a valid Network Activation Protocol.

NetworkActivationEx_INVALID_XPATH=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value is not a valid XPath Expression, such value is not a valid Network Activation Device Selector. Replace it with an XPath Expression, which match the Network Activation Device XML Element Node of the related Instance.
NetworkActivationEx_TOO_MANY_MATCH=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this XPath Expression selects {1} XML Nodes, this value is not a valid Network Activation Device Selector. Replace it with an XPath Expression, which match the Network Activation Device XML Element Node of the related Instance.
NetworkActivationEx_NO_MATCH=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this XPath Expression selects no XML Node, this value is not a valid Network Activation Device Selector. Replace it with an XPath Expression, which match the Network Activation Device XML Element Node of the related Instance.
NetworkActivationEx_NOT_MATCH_ELMT=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this expression select an XML ''{1}'' Node, this value is not a valid Network Activation Device Selector. Replace it with an XPath Expression, which match the Network Activation Device XML Element Node of the related Instance.

NetworkActivatorMsg_INTRO=Loading Network Activation datas for Instance Element [{0}].
NetworkActivatorMsg_RESUME=Network Activation datas are {0}.
NetworkActivatorEx_CREATION_FAILED=Failed to load Network Activation Datas.

WinRmNetworkActivatorEx_NOT_SUPPORTED=WINRM Activation Protocol is not implemented yet.

SshNetworkActivatorMsg_WAIT_FOR_ENABLEMENT=Waiting for Network Activation on ''{0}:{1}''.
SshNetworkActivatorMsg_ENABLEMENT_DONE=Network Activation feature adds ''{0}/{1}'' to known_hosts file.
SshNetworkActivatorMsg_DISABLEMENT_DONE=Network Activation feature removes ''{0}/{1}'' from known_hosts file.
SshNetworkActivatorEx_ENABLEMENT_TIMEOUT=Network Activation timeout. You should increase the ''{0}''.

NetworkDeviceListEx_DEVICE_ALREADY_DEFINE=''{0}'': Not accepted. A Network Device with the same device-name has already been declared. \
It is not allowed to attach two (or more) Network Device with the same device-name to an Instance. \
To solve this issue, change the device-name of the Network Device.

NetworkDevLoaderEx_MISSING_ATTR=Mandatory ''{0}'' Attribute is missing.
NetworkDevLoaderEx_GENERIC_ERROR=This Network Device description is not valid. Read message bellow to get more details about this issue.

NetMgmtEx_MISSING=No Network Management Element found. To solve this issue, you must declare a ''{0}'' XML Element under this Element.
NetMgmtEx_MISSING_ATTR=Attribute ''{0}'' is missing.
NetMgmtEx_INVALID_ATTR=Attribute ''{0}'' is invalid.
NetMgmtEx_SELECTOR_INVALID_XPATH=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this value is not a valid XPath Expression, such value is not a valid Network Devices Selector. Replace it with an XPath Expression, which match some Network Device XML Element Nodes of the related Instance.
NetMgmtEx_SELECTOR_NOT_MATCH_ELMT=''{0}'': Not accepted. Since this expression doesn''t target only XML Element Nodes, such value is not a valid Network Devices Selector. Replace it with an XPath Expression, which match some Network Device XML Element Nodes of the related Instance.
